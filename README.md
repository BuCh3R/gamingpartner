# gamingpartner
A gaming forum for 5 diffirent computer games for danish people only.

purpose of site: To easily find teammates witch a common language.

since it is primarely made for wide screen users, the smaller screen devices is not optimal, but is still functional.

used html, css, javascript and php.

issues: profile page, uploading a picture to your own profile, was rather difficult and is currently not optimal; was good practice.

feel free to criticise it https://gamingpartner.dk/ i happily take whatever i can get.
